# Quiztronic By Jan Samuel Owczarek
console game
 
Files 1-5.txt are only for checking if all is correct working they need to be puted in the same direction as executable file. Exampel files can be found in folder files.
 
This game was created as part of learning C++. If you see any way to improve me code pleas notify me.
Thank you.
